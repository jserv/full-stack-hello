# full-stack-hello

`full-stack-hello` is a minimal virtual machine kit capable of performing
tasks at any level of the technical stack on which a typical 'Hello World'
program execution depends. It means:
* Instruction Set Architecture (ISA);
* Virtual machine implementing the ISA;
* Assembly and/or Compiler following the ISA;
* Runtime support such as standard libraries and ELF;

## Instruction set

| Opcode  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| OP_ADD | sum two operands |
| OP_SUB | subtract two operands |
| OP_MUL | multiply two operands |
| OP_DIV | divide two two operands |
| OP_MOD | Modulo, remainder of operand 1 divided by operand 2 |
| OP_PRINT | print integer or string |
| OP_JLT | jump to specified address (in operand 2) if operand 1 is less than 0 |
| OP_JLE | jump to specified address (in operand 2) if operand 1 is less than or equal to 0 |
| OP_JZ | jump to specified address (in operand 2) if operand 1 is equal to 0 |
| OP_JGE | jump to specified address (in operand 2) if operand 1 is greater than or equal to 0 |
| OP_JGT | jump to specified address (in operand 2) if operand 1 is greater than 0 |
| OP_JNZ | jump to specified address (in operand 2) if operand 1 is not equal to 0 |
| OP_JMP | jump to specified address |
| OP_CALL | call to specified address |
| OP_RET | return to where called from |
| OP_HALT | terminate VM |

## Assembly Notation

* Registers are specified by `#` as temporary storage.
    * `print #1` dumps the content of register `#1`.
* An immediate value (or simply an immediate or imm) is a piece of data that
is stored as part of the instruction itself instead of being in a memory
location or a register.
    * `mul $-2 $2 #4` stores the result of `(-2) * (2)` into register `#4`.
* A valid Label name ends with `:` and is referred as `:X` in any JMP/CALL
  instructions to jump to label `X`.
    ```
    A:
    print $1
    jmp :A
    ```
    * Infinite loop that dumps constant `1`.

## Build and Verify

```shell
$ make
cc -Wall -std=gnu99 -g -c -o vm.o -MMD -MF .vm.o.d vm.c
cc -Wall -std=gnu99 -g -c -o as.o -MMD -MF .as.o.d as.c
cc -Wall -std=gnu99 -g -c -o driver.o -MMD -MF .driver.o.d driver.c
cc -Wall -std=gnu99 -g -o as_exec vm.o as.o driver.o
$ make check

## Assembler Usage
Specify -h to obtain the description of the assembler.
```
$ ./as_exec -h
Usage: as_exec [-w] [-x] [-o <out_file>] <in_file>
       -w Assemble <in_file> and write to an ELF file, see -o below
       -o if -w is specifed, <out_file> is used to store the object code
       -x Load <in_file> and execute it

       <in_file> the file name to be used by commands above
```
For example, if the assembly file in concern is tests/coverage.s
1. Assemble an assembly source file and evaluate (execute) it.
   ```
   ./as_exec tests/hello.s
   ```
2. Assemble an assembly source file and write to default ELF file tests/hello.o.
   ```
   ./as_exec -w tests/hello.s
   ```
3. Assemble an assembly source file and write to default ELF file tests/temp.o.
   ```
   ./as_exec -o tests/temp.o -w tests/hello.s
   ```
4. Laod an assembled ELF file tests/hello.o and evaluate (rexcute) it.
   ```
   ./as_exec -x tests/hello.o
   ```
The common ELF tools, such as objdump, can be applied to the output ELF file.
```
objdump -x tests/hello.o
```
Currently, the ELF support is very limited and could be improved.
